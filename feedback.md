# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds Expectations**. The comments in your readme are very helpful!! I especially like your installation instructions and user stories.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Chase - I'm super impressed with your d3 skills!!! In addition, your object oriented approach to war looks great! More on 
this in the code comments. It's also quite entertaining to watch the game play itself. Awesome awesome job on the visualizations in this game.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations**. A single global variable!!! This is ideal. I think there are a few places in your code that you can move stylistic things
to your stylesheet, but overall I am impressed with your implementation. If you were to continue working on this project, I would encourage you
to think of a way to support an unlimited number of players. Even if you hardcode `numPlayers = 2`, think of ways to deal cards / calculate score
based on whatever that number is as opposed to relying on indexes `0` and `1`

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Your comments in readme.md are excellent!! Would you mind if I shared this with the class as a great example? Your process and
remaining unsolved problems will be useful for you to look at in the future before an interview or if you decide to jump back into the code base.

Overall fantastic job on project 1!!! looking forward to seeing what you do with the next one.
